        1. Fix the tests by changing `ApolloMockProvider` to blah

        ```js
        // An example snippet goes here
        ```

        **Outcome**: More things exploded with this new error 'Aryo help meeee!!!'

        2. Add this config to jest config file

        ```json
        {
          uselessConfig: true
        }
        ```

        **Outcome**: Nothing changed
